Work Organization:

For this assignment, we didn't use any tools to help us organize. We worked on some parts together and divided the other tasks. For example:

Adrià handled the sprites, animations, and created the collision functions...

Dídac took care of the debug keys, respawn conditions, some physics aspects, and the map...

Overall, we both worked hard and didn't feel like we were shouldering each other's workload.
